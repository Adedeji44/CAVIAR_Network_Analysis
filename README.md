## CAVIAR_Network_Analysis - Generating Networks Graphs and Analysing using Centrality Measures.
## Eigenvector, Betweenness, and Closeness Centrality measures

Project is based on information on the CAVIAR project and the role of certain individuals arrested following the investigation. The investigation lasted two years and ran from 1994 to 1996. The operation was brought together by investigation units of the Montreal police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of Canada. During these two years, 11 wiretap warrants, valid for about two months each, were obtained (11 matrices match these phases).

**Objective - We will analyze and understand a time-varying criminal network that was repeatedly disrupted by police forces, and how the criminal network reoriented in response to the seizures of product by the police forces.**
